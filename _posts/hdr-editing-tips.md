## Introduction to HDR Photography

High Dynamic Range (HDR) photography is a technique that involves capturing multiple photos of the same scene at different exposure levels and then merging them together to create a single image. This method allows you to capture a greater range of tonal detail than a single exposure can, resulting in photos that are more representative of what the human eye sees. For real estate, this means bright, clear window views without plunging the interior into shadow.

### 1. Always Use a Tripod

Stability is paramount when shooting for HDR. Because you're taking multiple shots that will be layered on top of each other, even the slightest camera movement can result in a blurry, unusable final image.

- **Consistency:** A tripod ensures each bracketed shot is perfectly aligned.
- **Sharpness:** It eliminates camera shake, leading to crisper details, which is crucial for showcasing property features.

### 2. Shoot in RAW Format

Shooting in RAW gives you the maximum amount of image data to work with in post-processing. JPEGs are compressed and lose a significant amount of detail, which can limit your ability to recover highlights and shadows effectively.

> RAW files are like a digital negative, containing all the unprocessed data from the camera's sensor. This gives you unparalleled flexibility during the editing phase.

### 3. Use Auto Exposure Bracketing (AEB)

Most modern DSLRs and mirrorless cameras have an Auto Exposure Bracketing (AEB) feature. This allows you to automatically take a series of photos (usually 3, 5, or 7) at different exposures.

- **Standard Bracketing:** A typical setup for interiors is a 3-shot bracket at -2, 0, and +2 exposure values.
- **Complex Scenes:** For rooms with very bright windows and dark corners, a 5-shot bracket might be necessary to capture the full dynamic range.

### 4. Focus on the Details During the Merge

When it's time to merge your photos, pay close attention to the details. Modern software like Adobe Lightroom or Photomatix Pro does a great job, but manual adjustments are often necessary.

- **Ghosting:** Look for and correct any "ghosting" artifacts caused by movement between frames (like leaves outside a window).
- **Natural Look:** The goal is a natural-looking image, not an over-processed, surreal one. Adjust sliders for highlights, shadows, and saturation carefully to maintain realism.

| **Tripod**      | Ensures perfect alignment for sharp images.      |
| **RAW Format**  | Provides maximum data for editing flexibility.   |
| **AEB**         | Automates capturing different exposures.         |
| **Manual Merge**| Gives you fine control over the final look.      |

### 5. Perfect the White Balance

Correct white balance is what makes an interior look clean, fresh, and inviting. Different light sources (daylight, tungsten bulbs, fluorescent lights) have different color temperatures.

- **Use a Grey Card:** For perfect accuracy, shoot a reference photo with a grey card in the room.
- **Adjust in Post:** Use the white balance dropper tool in your editing software to select a neutral grey or white area in the photo to correct the color cast.

By following these five tips, you'll be well on your way to creating stunning HDR images that do justice to your real estate listings and capture the attention of potential buyers.
