## Good Editing Sells, Bad Editing Repels

In real estate photography, the goal of editing is to make a property look its absolute best while remaining realistic and appealing. However, it's easy to go too far. Over-editing can make a property look fake and can erode buyer trust. Here are seven common mistakes to steer clear of.

### 1. Over-Saturating Colors

**The Mistake:** Pushing the saturation and vibrance sliders to the max, resulting in neon green grass and unnaturally deep blue skies.
**The Fix:** Aim for natural, vibrant colors. Instead of global saturation, use the HSL panel to target specific colors. Boost the blues in the sky and the greens in the lawn, but keep skin tones and interior colors looking realistic.

### 2. Unrealistic HDR Effects

**The Mistake:** Creating an "overcooked" HDR image with crunchy textures, halos around objects, and a flat, surreal look.
**The Fix:** The goal of HDR is to replicate what the human eye sees. Blend exposures carefully and aim for a balanced, natural-looking dynamic range. Shadows should have detail, but they should still look like shadows.

### 3. Warped or Converging Verticals

**The Mistake:** Leaving vertical lines (walls, door frames, windows) tilted or converging. This makes a room feel unstable and is a tell-tale sign of amateur photography.
**The Fix:** Use the lens correction and transform tools in your editing software to ensure all vertical lines are perfectly straight. This one simple fix instantly makes a photo look more professional.

### 4. Ignoring Color Casts

**The Mistake:** Leaving a noticeable color cast from mixed lighting sources, making white walls look yellow, blue, or green.
**The Fix:** Use the white balance tool to correct for color casts. Select a neutral gray or white point in the image to set the correct white balance. For tricky mixed lighting, you may need to use adjustment brushes to correct different areas of the room separately.

### 5. Over-Sharpening

**The Mistake:** Applying too much sharpening, which creates harsh edges, digital noise, and distracting artifacts.
**The Fix:** Sharpening should be subtle. Apply it as the very last step in your workflow. Use a masking feature to apply sharpening only to the edges and textures, not to smooth areas like skies or walls.

### 6. Unnatural Sky Replacements

**The Mistake:** Dropping in a sky that doesn't match the lighting or weather conditions of the original photo. A bright, sunny sky on an obviously overcast day looks jarring and fake.
**The Fix:** Choose a replacement sky that matches the direction and quality of light in the original scene. Ensure the color temperature of the sky blends seamlessly with the rest of the image.

### 7. Leaving Clutter in the Shot

**The Mistake:** Not removing distracting elements like stray power cords, trash cans, or pool cleaning equipment.
**The Fix:** Use spot healing or clone stamp tools to remove small distracting objects. For larger items, professional object removal services can declutter a scene, creating a cleaner, more appealing final image.

Avoiding these common pitfalls will ensure your photos are polished, professional, and effective at attracting buyers.
